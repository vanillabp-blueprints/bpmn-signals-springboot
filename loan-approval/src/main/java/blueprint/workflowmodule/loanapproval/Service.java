/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code loanRequested} rather than "start the process", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Publishing the rate is where a signal reads differently from a message: the method takes
 * no loan approval. It is news about the market, not about one business case, and the
 * broadcast reaches whoever happens to be waiting for it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow and broadcasting a signal have to run in a transaction. It is
 * deliberately absent from the methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a task
 * in a transaction it owns, and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on
 * purpose. A transaction declared here would roll back instead and throw away what the
 * handler wrote for the process to react to. VanillaBP sees the transaction it can no
 * longer commit and fails the task naming it, so the mistake shows up rather than costing
 * data.
